# TinySTL

TinySTL is a minimal implementation of a subset of the C++ STL (Standard Template Library), designed to help you learn the underlying principles and implementation techniques of STL.

## Directory Structure

- `source/`  Main source code
- `test/`    Test code

## Features
- Simple implementations of basic containers (such as vector, list, map, etc.)
- Basic support for iterators and algorithms
- Clean code style for easy learning and extension

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/tinystl.git
   ```
2. Enter the project directory and build the source code:
   ```sh
   cd tinystl
   # Use your preferred C++ compiler to build the code in source/
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```sh
   # Compile and run the test code in test/
   ```
